    "text": "This course provides an in-depth look at both basic and advanced statistical methods, aimed at fostering a deep understanding of data analysis and statistical inference.\nUsing Python and Excel, the curriculum focuses on equipping students with the skills to effectively analyze, interpret, and present data. The content spans from data fundamentals, through exploratory data analysis of both categorical and numerical data, to more complex topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, and the foundations of statistical inference. The course culminates in applying these concepts to hypothesis testing and real-world data analysis. By the end, students will be adept at using statistical techniques and ready for careers or further study requiring data analysis proficiency.",
