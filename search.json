The content spans from data fundamentals, through exploratory data analysis of both categorical and numerical data, to more complex topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, and the foundations of statistical inference. The course culminates in applying these concepts to hypothesis testing and real-world data analysis. By the end, students will be adept at using statistical techniques and ready for careers or further study requiring data analysis proficiency.",
